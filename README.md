# ERC20 Model

This repo contains an abstract model of an ERC20 token, specified in K.

Two erc20 reference implementations are included that not only differ in implementation, but design.

We will model these designs and compare them against the more abstract ERC20 specification to check whether
each design correctly refines the erc20 specification.

This is an exercise in K as well as refinement proofs.
